## Phase 0 — Foundations (registry + contracts)

**Status: built, unverified.** Nothing has been executed — Node.js is not
installed on this machine (see `SETUP.md`). The exit criterion is unmet until
`npm run registry:dump` actually prints 154 agents.

### What was built

**Contracts** (`packages/shared`) — the spine from PLAN.md §1.4.

- `status.ts` — run and assignment state machines with explicit transition
  tables, plus `ASSIGNMENT_BEHAVIOUR`: the §1.2 animation binding expressed as
  data, so the office sim owns no status of its own.
- `plan.ts` — `RunPlanSchema`. Rejects duplicate ids, self-dependencies, and
  forward or same-phase dependencies. That last rule makes dispatcher deadlock
  structurally impossible rather than a runtime concern.
  `validatePlanAgainstRegistry` returns structured issues instead of throwing,
  so FR-M3 repair-retries can feed them back to the Manager.
- `events.ts` — the normalised `AgentEvent` union every provider flattens into.
- `agent.ts` — `AgentDef` and the catalog's category list.

**Registry** (`packages/server`) — FR-R1 through FR-R3.

- `registry/parse.ts` — frontmatter parser. CRLF-aware, BOM-stripping, fails
  loudly with file path and line number.
- `registry/index.ts` — `loadRegistry` collects *every* parse failure and
  duplicate name before throwing, rather than dying on the first. Plus
  `buildRosterDigest` and an explicitly-approximate `estimateTokens`.
- `scripts/dump.ts` — the Phase 0 exit-criterion CLI.

66 tests written across 4 files. None have run.

### Findings

**1. Eight agent files are not valid YAML.** They write an unquoted
`description` containing a colon-space, which terminates a plain scalar, so a
conforming parser rejects the file. A naive `yaml.parse` would have thrown on
every one and silently cost us 8 agents — including `gdpr-ccpa-compliance` and
`hipaa-compliance`, the two compliance specialists the legal and tax use cases
route to.

Affected: `gdpr-ccpa-compliance`, `hipaa-compliance`, `assumption-mapping`,
`backlog-grooming`, `growth-loops`, `ab-test-analysis`, `cohort-analysis`,
`first-principles-thinking` — the same 8 that omit `model:`, i.e. one
contributor's house style.

Handled by a narrow normalisation pre-pass. This is a *silent repair*, which
FR-R2 otherwise forbids; the deviation and its reasoning are recorded in
PLAN.md §2.1. The real fix is upstream.

**2. The catalog holds 154 agents, not 164.** The earlier figure counted the 10
category `README.md` files. Corrected throughout PLAN.md.

**3. PLAN.md described `model:` as "often inherit".** Wrong — `sonnet` is the
plurality at 103 of 146. Corrected.

### Known risks carried forward

- `yaml` v2's `YAMLParseError.linePos` shape is assumed. If it differs, line
  numbers degrade to `undefined` at runtime (non-fatal), but `tsc` could fail.
- `@agent-office/shared` exports TypeScript source. Works under `tsx` and
  `vitest`; needs a build step before anything runs under bare Node.
- The 154-agent assertion is a deliberate snapshot. Adding an agent fails it.

### Blockers

- **Node.js not installed.** Blocks verification of everything above.
- **`claude` CLI not on PATH.** Blocks Phase 1 entirely.

### Next

Phase 2 (orchestrator core) is the only remaining phase that depends on neither
missing binary, so it can proceed while those are installed.

---

## Phase 2 — Orchestrator core (headless)

**Status: built, unverified.** Still no Node, so none of the 191 tests have run.
The stated exit criterion — an end-to-end run producing reports and a synthesis,
checked on two domains — is **not met**. What exists is the whole pipeline
written and unit-tested against a deterministic fake provider.

### The unblocking decision

Phase 2 needs something to execute agents, and Phase 1's Claude Code adapter is
blocked on a missing CLI. Rather than wait, the orchestrator was built against
the **provider interface** (§1.6) with a `ScriptedProvider` behind it.

That was going to be necessary regardless. Testing concurrency caps, timeouts,
cancellation and partial failure against a real model would be slow, expensive
and non-deterministic — the scripted provider is the only way those paths get
covered at all. It is registered as a real `ProviderId` rather than hidden in
test files, so `npm run run -- "task" --provider scripted` exercises the entire
pipeline at zero cost.

### What was built

**Provider seam** — `providers/types.ts`, `providers/scripted.ts`.
One deviation from PLAN.md §1.6, recorded in the file: `AgentRunRequest` carries
an `assignmentId`. Every `AgentEvent` is stamped with one, and the alternative —
having the caller rewrite each event — puts provider knowledge back into the
orchestrator, which is precisely what the seam exists to prevent.

**Persistence** — `store/` (`types`, `util`, `memoryStore`, `fileStore`).
Atomic writes are temp-file + `fsync` + `rename` within the same directory, since
`rename` is only atomic inside one filesystem. Applied to reports as well as
`run.json`. Report paths come from the Manager's LLM-generated `deliverable`
field and are treated as untrusted: anything escaping the run directory is
rejected (NFR-1).

**Manager** — `orchestrator/manager.ts`.
Planning and synthesis, both composed from the catalog's own orchestration
agents (FR-M1). `extractPlanJson` handles the four ways a model wraps JSON. The
repair loop feeds specific validation errors back and, for hallucinated agent
names, the valid-name list (FR-M2/FR-M3). Provider failures deliberately do not
consume the repair budget — feeding "CLI exited 1" back as a validation error
cannot help the Manager.

**Dispatcher** — `orchestrator/brief.ts`, `orchestrator/dispatcher.ts`.
Phase sequencing, concurrency cap, per-assignment timeout, cancellation, token
budget.

**Runner and CLI** — `orchestrator/runner.ts`, `scripts/run.ts`.

### Decisions worth remembering

- **A dependent whose dependency failed is skipped, never run.** Briefing it
  without the report it declared a dependency on would silently degrade its
  input instead of failing visibly.
- **Cancellation mid-flight leaves the assignment in `working`.** The persisted
  run then shows where it was interrupted rather than misreporting a failure.
- **Exhausting the token budget skips synthesis.** Synthesis is itself a large
  call; spending more tokens to report running out of tokens is the wrong trade.
  Partial reports are preserved on disk (FR-M8).
- **The brief carries the task, the objective, and declared dependencies only.**
  With a shared context, every agent's prompt grows with every other agent's
  output and run cost becomes quadratic in team size.
- **The run passes through `designing` as a no-op.** Phase 5 fills the step in
  without disturbing the surrounding transitions.

### Known risks carried forward

- **The planning prompt's worked example uses a software trio**
  (`backend-developer`, `security-auditor`, `code-reviewer`). Models anchor hard
  on examples; the first legal or tax run is where this shows. Fix is a
  non-software example or rotation by domain.
- **Synthesis truncates at 24k chars per report.** Twelve agents still overflow.
  Documented as a degradation, not a fix — hierarchical synthesis is the answer.
- **`JSON.parse` is strict**; trailing commas and comments cost a repair attempt.
- **`rename` over an open `run.json` on Windows** can return `EPERM`/`EBUSY` if
  antivirus or a file watcher holds a handle. This is the highest-frequency
  filesystem operation in the app (NFR-2 saves after every transition), so it may
  need a retry loop.
- **`listRuns` reads every `run.json`** — an argument for the Phase 7 SQLite
  move, not a bug.

### Blockers

Unchanged: **Node.js not installed** blocks all verification; **`claude` CLI not
on PATH** blocks Phase 1.

### Next

Phase 3 (web shell) needs Node to be useful, so the honest next step is
installing Node and running `npm test` + `npm run run -- "..." --provider
scripted` to close out Phases 0 and 2 for real.
